## Break Glass: How to Securely Administer Computers Using Jamf Pro LAPS

Tuesday, Oct 1
3:30 PM - 4:15 PM CDT
With Rob Potvin and Mark Buffington
 
LAPS is Jamf Pro's new Local Administrator Password Solution, designed to solve a security problem found in many environments today:
 
Your fleet shares the same administrator username and password across every computer.
You can't be sure who knows these credentials.
You can't easily change their passwords quickly.

Let's talk about why all Jamf Pro customers should be using LAPS for shared IT admin accounts and how to implement Jamf Pro's version of LAPS in your environment. If you're coming from a Windows administrator background, it's managed differently, but the outcome is the same.

We'll cover Jamf Pro's two available LAPS implementations and which is right for you. We'll discuss how to turn it on and how to use it. And finally, we'll offer some best practices for a few situations customers may see in their environment.

If you haven't yet implemented a LAPS solution in your environment, Jamf Pro LAPS is the best security tool you can put into action this year.

## Exploring Serialized Data Formats for Fun and Profit

October 02 | 09:00 CDT

There are many serialized data formats, but three of them, XML, PLIST and JSON, stand out against the background when managing Apple operating systems. In this session, we will explore these formats, from their simple specifications to more complex examples, helping to build up our mental models. We will also compare their similarities and differences and get to know the tooling that comes preinstalled on our Macs, using them to manipulate and extract data from these formats.

## ZTNA Common Misconceptions and Why It Should Replace Your VPN

October 03 | 10:15 AM CDT

For those who want to learn how ZTNA can revolutionize network security and access in their organizations, we will review the steps for identity providers to enforce and route traffic effectively with Jamf Trust. We will showcase configurations for Google, Okta, and Entra ID, and user experience on all four platforms (macOS, iOS, Windows, Android), along with the benefits and core features of Jamf Security Cloud in relation to accessing on-premises or private cloud resources.

## How To Succeed With Your Plan for Failure

October 03 | 10:15 AM - 11:00 AM CDT

Jamf Pro doesn’t have an “undo.” You need to create your own. Be prepared before you respond to something like this in Jamf Pro:
 
Are you sure you want to delete...?

This action is permanent and cannot be undone.
Cancel  |  Delete
 
Backups are the unsexy part of an administrator’s job, but they are the potential difference between an IT professional working with a safety net vs. someone speeding toward an unwanted RGE (résumé generating event).

We’ll cover:
 
Understanding safeguards built into Jamf Pro and not built into Jamf Pro
The correct procedure for backing up your on-premises servers
Protecting your Jamf Pro data (computer and mobile device inventory) and objects (configuration profiles, policies, reports and more)
Tools you should keep in your administrator’s toolbox
 
And when mistakes do happen, we’ll cover:
 
Restoring your lost data or configurations
 
Repeat this mantra: “Plan to fail. Don’t fail to plan.”

## ZTNA Common Misconceptions and Why It Should Replace Your VPN

October 03 | 10:15 AM - 11:00 AM CDT

Join us as we uncover why “just setting an access policy” in Jamf Security Cloud (RADAR) isn’t enough. In this session, we will debunk common ZTNA misconceptions, explain why ZTNA should replace your VPN and discover the steps required by an identity provider to effectively enforce and route traffic. We will specifically explore the configuration of three identity providers (Google, Okta and Entra ID) to ensure an optimal end-user experience supported by Jamf Trust. Don’t miss this opportunity to gain valuable insights and skills to enhance your network security with advanced access management strategies!
 
## Demystifying Custom Analytics for Jamf Protect

October 03 | 11:30 AM - 12:15 PM CDT

Jamf Protect (macOS portal) comes with a multitude of Jamf-managed analytics. However, there are times when customers need to monitor activity that is specific to their security requirements or individual circumstances.

This talk aims to demystify how to create, test and deploy custom analytics. In this session, we will:
Understand what an analytic is by looking at some existing ones
Look at event types and their capabilities, including attributes available
Look at analytic chains
Deep dive into predicates, using various examples
Look at some of the tools we can use to get information that the predicate may require
Go over examples of using ‘and’ and ‘or’ boolean logic in the predicate

# Interactive Lab - Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday 
## Unified Logging to Jamf Protect for macOS Analytic - Interactive Lab
Tuesday, Oct 1
2:15 PM - 3:00 PM CDT

Wednesday, Oct 2
9:00 AM - 9:45 AM CDT

Thursday, Oct 3
10:15 AM - 11:00 AM CDT

Bring your own Mac! In this lab, you have a hands-on experience on how to construct a Unified Log Filter to parse relevant information. Next, you'll use that filter to create both an Analytic and a Unified Logging Filter in Jamf Protect for macOS.
