##Break Glass: How to Securely Administer Computers Using Jamf Pro LAPS
With Rob Potvin and Mark Buffington
 
LAPS is Jamf Pro's new Local Administrator Password Solution, designed to solve a security problem found in many environments today:
 
Your fleet shares the same administrator username and password across every computer.
You can't be sure who knows these credentials.
You can't easily change their passwords quickly.

Let's talk about why all Jamf Pro customers should be using LAPS for shared IT admin accounts and how to implement Jamf Pro's version of LAPS in your environment. If you're coming from a Windows administrator background, it's managed differently, but the outcome is the same.

We'll cover Jamf Pro's two available LAPS implementations and which is right for you. We'll discuss how to turn it on and how to use it. And finally, we'll offer some best practices for a few situations customers may see in their environment.

If you haven't yet implemented a LAPS solution in your environment, Jamf Pro LAPS is the best security tool you can put into action this year.
 
 
##How To Succeed With Your Plan for Failure
 
Jamf Pro doesn’t have an “undo.” You need to create your own. Be prepared before you respond to something like this in Jamf Pro:
 
Are you sure you want to delete...?

This action is permanent and cannot be undone.
Cancel  |  Delete
 
Backups are the unsexy part of an administrator’s job, but they are the potential difference between an IT professional working with a safety net vs. someone speeding toward an unwanted RGE (résumé generating event).

We’ll cover:
 
Understanding safeguards built into Jamf Pro and not built into Jamf Pro
The correct procedure for backing up your on-premises servers
Protecting your Jamf Pro data (computer and mobile device inventory) and objects (configuration profiles, policies, reports and more)
Tools you should keep in your administrator’s toolbox
 
And when mistakes do happen, we’ll cover:
 
Restoring your lost data or configurations
 
Repeat this mantra: “Plan to fail. Don’t fail to plan.”
